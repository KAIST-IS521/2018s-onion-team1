gpg --armor --export you@example.com > mykey.asc

GnuPG to OpenSSH

First, you need to know fingerprint of your RSA key. You can use:
  gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format short


Next, you can use openpgp2ssh tool distributed in with monkeyshpere project:
 gpg --export-secret-keys 01234567 | openpgp2ssh 01234567 > id_rsa

A few notes are necessary:

1, 01234567 must be fingerprint of a RSA key (or subkey)
2. gpg --export-secret-keys also accept finger print of global key (in this case, it exports all sub-keys). However, openpgp2ssh only accept finger print of an RSA key
3. If no arguments are provided, openpgp2ssh export RSA keys it find


You can now extract ssh public key using:
  ssh-keygen -y -f id_rsa > id_rsa.pub
