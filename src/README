# how to test this program?

1. install NCURSES library (apt-get install libncurses-dev)
2. add three users (adduser user1; adduser user2; adduser user3)
3. Make this! (make)
4. start dbserver from some other terminal (./dbserver)
5. start three instances of dvonion (from user1, user2, user3's terminal)
6. send/recv message (e.g., /sendmsg user3 hello!)



# before step 4...

users should be sudo user to run gpg. add below 3 line.

$ sudo vi /etc/sudoers 
user1 ALL=(ALL) ALL   # Change the user name before you issue the commands
user2 ALL=(ALL) ALL   # Change the user name before you issue the commands
user3 ALL=(ALL) ALL   # Change the user name before you issue the commands


#instead... it is better..
chmod -R 777 .gnugpg
